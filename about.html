            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 10px; padding: 10px;">What is this?</h4>
            <p>As stated on our home page, this website is a final project put together to replicate what a normal website of an Equestrian Center would look like!</p>
            <p>Viridity Equestrian Center was initially created by Kelly Anne Williams, a Junior at New York University, as a project to showcase Web Design skills in hopes to score a commission for equestrian businesses in the real world. In addition, this example of a website can be applied to video game based communities for the near future.</p>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 10px; padding: 10px;">Is this real?</h4>
            <p>Obviously not. It's kind of a "make believe" scenario of an Equestrian Center and all aspects of it were created by imagination. As someone who plays video games, I enjoy coming up with different ideas and concepts of alternate realities.</p>
            <p>Most images used are from the video game, Star Stable Online.</p>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline-offset: 10px; padding: 10px;">What the heck is Star Stable?</h4>
            <p>Star Stable Online is a video game oriented towards a younger audience interested in horses. In its multiplayer open world, it consists of races, quests, custom characterization, and interaction with other players.</p>
            <p>I bought a lifetime membership in 2013... I think I was 11 years old. Until a couple months ago, I didn't realize the game was still running and my lifetime membership still worked! It was like my Poptropica or Club Penguin growing up.</p>
