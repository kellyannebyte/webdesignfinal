            <p>Taking exceptional care of your horse is our number one priority. All horses enjoy the outstanding care of our attentive staff. Our barn management team and knowledgeable staff are on hand seven days a week to oversee the care of the horses living at Viridity.</p>
            <p>Whether your horse is a youngster still learning his craft or a seasoned campaigner, we will work with you and your horse to develop a training program that ensures you reach your goals.</p>
            <p>Viridity Equestrian Center offers high quality care for the competition horse. Horses are fed Jorvik Premium feeds twice daily and high quality timothy/alfalfa hay three times daily. Stalls are cleaned two times per day and 4 bags of shavings are added weekly. Additionally, all buckets are cleaned daily.</p>
            <p>Horses receive a minimum of 3 hours of turnout per day, unless special request. Blankets are changed and boots are put on as needed for pasturing. All horse's hooves are picked out when they come in from turnout.</p>
            <p>Personalized attention to the needs of every horse ensures they are happy and content, ready to perform at their best for their riders. Full Service and Training Board packages are available.</p>
            <p>In addition to feeding and stall care, services include coordination of vet and farrier appointments, administration of medications, and injury/illness care.</p>
